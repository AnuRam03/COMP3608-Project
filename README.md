# COMP3608-Project

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for our Intelligent Systems project in COMP 3608. Our goal is to utilize 3 datasets and three algorithms to identify fradulant credit card transactions.

## Datasets:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023 \
This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities.

2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud \
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. PCA was used to anomize the data.

3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud \
This dataset from an unamed institute contains credit card transactions and unobscured features such as distance from home, distance from last transaction, ratio to median purchase price, repeat retailer, etc. It contains 100,000 data points of which 87,000 are fraud.

## Algorithms:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Support Vetor Machines

## Technologies:
Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
